{% include JB/setup %}

This is my first post in my Github based blog. I have no blogging experience but I'll do my best and share things about I like as much as I can. 

I created this blog following the Github Pages. If you would like to do the same you can start from <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">here</a>. In order to see my blog locally, I also installed all the components such as Ruby, RubyGems, Bundler and Jekyll on my computer. The instructions are clearly described in Github Pages link. I saw many nice blogs using Jekyll-Bootstrap (JB) and wanted to build my blog on top of it too. So as a next step I cloned the files and read the documentation from this <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank"> link</a>. After a few small modifications, I pushed my local files and folders to Github. 

Files that I modified initially are:

<ul>
	<li><code>_config.yml</code></li>
	<li><code>index.md</code></li>
</ul>

I would like to keep this first post short so that I can focus on the modifications.
